This path avoids all walls: r4c4 is to the left, r5c6 and r5c11 are offset, r7c3 is not crossed. Alternatives like descending in column 3 first are blocked by r7c3 wall, requiring detours, so column 5 descent is efficient and simple. Proposed solution: 10x DOWN followed by 2x LEFT.\n\n# Verification\nSimulate path:\n- Start: r1c5\n- 10 DOWN: r2c5 (-), r3c5 (-), r4c5 (-), r5c5 (-), r6c5 (-), r7c5 (-), r8c5 (-), r9c5 (-), r10c5 (-), r11c5 (-) → all valid, no walls.\n- LEFT: r11c4 (-) → valid.\n- LEFT: r11c3 (G) → valid, goal reached.\nNo out-of-bounds moves (columns 3-5, rows 1-11 within 1-13). Total moves: 12, avoids all #.\n\n# Rethink (Optional)\nNo errors found; path is clear and optimal in simplicity.\n\n# Summary\nThe path descends safely down column 5 to the goal row, then shifts left. Final verification: All segments empty, no walls hit, ends at r11c3.

Check upper paths. From r8c4 UP to r7c4 (open). Row 7 is open from c1-c4 and c6-c7 (c5#). Thus, from r7c4, move LEFT x3 to r7c1 (all open: r7c3, r7c2, r7c1).

Direct path: Move right along row 3 to c10 (8 right moves), as cells r3c3 to r3c10 are all empty.\n2. Then move down twice: r4c10 (empty) to r5c10 (goal).\n3. This avoids all walls: stays left of r3c11 wall, no issues in column 10 downward.\n4. Alternative paths exist (e.g., down first then right), but this is efficient (10 moves) and straightforward.\n5. No need for UP or LEFT, as they would detour unnecessarily.\n\nProposed solution: 8x RIGHT, then 2x DOWN.\n\n# Verification\nSimulate path:\n- Start: r3c2\n- RIGHT x8: r3c3(-), r3c4(-), ..., r3c10(-) → at r3c10\n- DOWN: r4c10(-)\n- DOWN: r5c10(G)\nAll cells passable, no walls hit, within bounds. Total moves: 10. Reaches goal exactly.\n\n# Rethink (Optional)\nNo errors found; path is optimal in simplicity and avoids all obstacles.\n\n# Summary\nThe grid offers a clear, direct path right then down. Final verification: Path confirmed valid, reaches r5c10 without issues. No shorter path needed, as it efficiently covers required displacement.\n\nFinal proposed solution: [\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"DOWN\", \"DOWN\"]\n</think>\n\n{\"solution\": [\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"RIGHT\",\"DOWN\",\"DOWN\"]}"}],"llmPathLength":10}

Thus, 3 DOWN moves reach the goal.\n\nNo walls interfere: r1c1 is above and irrelevant; r9c1 and r10c6 are below the goal.\nAlternative paths (e.g., down first then left) are possible but longer or equal; this is efficient (12 moves total).\n\nProposed solution: 9 LEFT followed by 3 DOWN.\n\n# Verification\nSimulate path:\n- Start: r2c10\n- 1st LEFT: r2c9 (-) → ... → 9th LEFT: r2c1 (-)\n- 1st DOWN: r3c1 (-) \n- 2nd DOWN: r4c1 (-)\n- 3rd DOWN: r5c1 (G)\nAll positions empty or goal; no walls hit; stays in bounds (rows 2-5, cols 1-10).\nPath length 12; valid.\n\n# Rethink (Optional)\nNo errors found; path is correct and optimal in simplicity.\n\n# Summary\nThe direct path along open row 2 left to c1, then down column 1 to r5 works perfectly.

UP to r3c3 (open).\n6. UP to r2c3 (open).\n7. LEFT to r2c2 (open).\n8. LEFT to r2c1 (G). This path avoids all walls and is efficient (8 moves, minimal due to 4 UP + 2 RIGHT + 2 LEFT detours).\n\n# Verification\nSimulate path:\n- Start: r6c1\n- RIGHT: r6c2 (-)\n- RIGHT: r6c3 (-)\n- UP: r5c3 (-)\n- UP: r4c3 (-)\n- UP: r3c3 (-)\n- UP: r2c3 (-)\n- LEFT: r2c2 (-)\n- LEFT: r2c1 (G)\nAll positions open, no bounds exceeded, no walls hit. r3c1 dead-end avoided.

Alternative paths (e.g., via column 4 or bottom loop) are blocked or longer (column 4 blocked at r5c4/r4c4; bottom has dead-ends).\n\n# Summary\nPath verified as correct and reaches goal.

The player can only move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT into empty cells (-), without going out of bounds.

Inspect the direct path rightward:\n- r2c8: -\n- r2c9: -\n- r2c10: -\n- r2c11: G\nNo walls block this path (nearest wall on row 2 is at c6, behind the player). Moving right four times reaches the goal directly without detours. Alternative paths (e.g., down or up) are longer and unnecessary due to walls like r3c7 and r1c8. This is the shortest and simplest solution.\nProposed solution: RIGHT four times.\n\n# Verification\nSimulate moves:\n1. Start: r2c7\n2. RIGHT: r2c8 (-) valid\n3. RIGHT: r2c9 (-) valid\n4.

UP: r12c10 → r11c10 (G).\nProposed solution: 8 RIGHT, 2 UP.\n\n# Verification\nPath positions checked:\n- r13c3 to r13c10: all '-' (empty).\n- r12c10: '-'.\n- r11c10: 'G' (target).\nNo walls encountered, no out-of-bounds moves (columns 2-10 within 1-12, rows 11-13 within 1-14).

Safest and straightforward path: move LEFT along row 4 to column 1 (r4c1), as row 4 has no walls. Then move UP along column 1 to r1c1, as column 1 has no walls in rows 1-4. This avoids both walls entirely.\n\nStep-by-step:\n1. From r4c10, LEFT 9 times to r4c1 (columns 10→9→8→7→6→5→4→3→2→1; row 4 empty).\n2. From r4c1, UP 3 times: r3c1 (empty), r2c1 (empty), r1c1 (goal).\n\nTotal moves: 9 LEFT + 3 UP = 12 moves. This is efficient and collision-free.\n\n# Verification\nPath trace:\nr4c10 → LEFT → r4c9 → ... → LEFT → r4c1 (9 LEFTs, all empty).\nr4c1 → UP → r3c1 (row3 col1 empty, not wall at c10).\nr3c1 → UP → r2c1 (row2 col1 empty, wall at c6).\nr2c1 → UP → r1c1 (goal).\nNo out-of-bounds, no walls hit. Correct.\n\n# Rethink (Optional)\nNo errors found; path is valid and optimal in simplicity.\n\n# Summary\nSolution verified: 9 LEFT moves to r4c1, then 3 UP to r1c1. Final check: avoids r2c6 and r3c10 completely, stays in bounds. Final proposed solution confirmed.</think>\n\n{\"solution\": [\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"UP\",\"UP\",\"UP\"]}"}],"llmPathLength":12}

The player can only move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, one cell at a time. The primary goal is to reach the goal at row 1, column 11 without hitting walls or going out of bounds. Key observations: the grid is mostly open with only four walls, allowing for straightforward paths to the top-right corner.\n\n# Key Details\n- Player starts at r7c3\n- Goal at r1c11\n- Walls at: r2c1, r8c7, r10c7, r12c3\n- Grid dimensions: 14 rows (1 at top to 14 at bottom), 11 columns (1 left to 11 right)\n- All other cells are empty (-)\n\n# Strategy Formulation\nThe grid has sparse obstacles, none of which block the direct Manhattan path. The net movement required is 6 rows up and 8 columns right (total 14 moves minimum). Row 7 is completely open from c3 to c11. Column 11 is completely open from r7 up to r1 (no walls in col11). Therefore, first move RIGHT 8 times along row 7 to r7c11, then UP 6 times along col11 to r1c11. This avoids all walls: the walls in col7 (r8,r10) and col3 (r12) are not on this path, and r2c1 is irrelevant. This is optimal as it matches the Manhattan distance.\nStep-by-step path:\n1. Start: r7c3\n2-9. 8x RIGHT → r7c11\n10-15. 6x UP → r6c11, r5c11, r4c11, r3c11, r2c11, r1c11 (goal)\n\n# Verification\nSimulate moves:\n- After 8 RIGHT: position r7c11 (row 7 fully open, no walls).\n- Then 6 UP: col11 has no walls (confirmed: row2 col11 empty, others open). Ends at r1c11. No out-of-bounds or wall hits. Path length 14, matches minimum.\n\n# Rethink (Optional)\nNo errors found; path is clear and optimal.\n\n# Summary\nThe solution moves right to column 11 then up to row 1, fully verified as valid, obstacle-free, and shortest.

This minimizes unnecessary moves and avoids backtracking.\n\nStep-by-step path:\n1. Start: r4c2\n2. RIGHT x6: r4c3, r4c4, r4c5, r4c6, r4c7, r4c8\n3. DOWN x5: r5c8, r6c8, r7c8, r8c8, r9c8 (goal)\n\nThis sequence totals 11 moves, which is optimal (Manhattan distance: 5+6=11).\n\nProposed solution: 6 RIGHT followed by 5 DOWN.\n\n# Verification\nSimulate the path:\n- Start r4c2\n- After 1st RIGHT: r4c3\n- 2nd: r4c4\n- 3rd: r4c5\n- 4th: r4c6\n- 5th: r4c7\n- 6th: r4c8\n- 1st DOWN: r5c8\n- 2nd: r6c8\n- 3rd: r7c8\n- 4th: r8c8\n- 5th: r9c8\nAll positions are within bounds (rows 1-10, cols 1-12) and empty/passable.

This avoids all walls by sticking to the left boundary.\n\nStep-by-step thought process:\n1. From r6c4, move LEFT three times to r6c1: r6c3, r6c2, r6c1 are all empty.\n2. Move UP four times to r2c1: r5c1 (empty row), r4c1 (empty), r3c1 (empty), r2c1 (empty).\n3. Move RIGHT twice to r2c3: r2c2 (empty), r2c3 (G).\n\nThis path is short, safe, and leverages open areas. Proposed solution: [\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"UP\", \"UP\", \"UP\", \"UP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\"]\n\n# Verification\nSimulate the path:\n- Start: r6c4\n- LEFT: r6c3 (-)\n- LEFT: r6c2 (-)\n- LEFT: r6c1 (-)\n- UP: r5c1 (-)\n- UP: r4c1 (-)\n- UP: r3c1 (-)\n- UP: r2c1 (-)\n- RIGHT: r2c2 (-)\n- RIGHT: r2c3 (G)\nAll moves land on empty cells or goal, no walls hit, stays in bounds (rows 2-6, cols 1-4).\n\n# Rethink (Optional)\nNo errors; path is optimal in simplicity and verified clear.\n\n# Summary\nThe leftward-then-upward-then-right path successfully navigates to the goal without obstacles. Final verification confirms 9 valid moves reaching r2c3 exactly.

The primary goal is to reach r4c5 from r2c9 using only UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT moves. Key constraints include impassable walls and grid edges.

Since the grid is mostly empty and the wall at r2c12 is not in the way (it's to the right of the starting column), a direct path is possible without detours.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. From r2c9, moving left along row 2 is clear: row 2 has empty cells from c1 to c11 (except c12 #, but we don't go there).\n2. Left 4 times reaches r2c5 (positions: c8, c7, c6, c5 all empty).\n3. From r2c5, down to r3c5 (row 3 fully empty).\n4. Down again to r4c5 (goal, empty except G which is reachable).\nThis avoids the wall entirely and stays in bounds (c5 is between 1-14, rows 2-4 between 1-5).\n\nAlternative paths exist (e.g., down first then left), but this is simple and minimal.\n\nProposed solution: [\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DOWN\", \"DOWN\"]\n\n# Verification\nSimulation:\n- Start: r2c9\n- LEFT: r2c8 (empty)\n- LEFT: r2c7 (empty)\n- LEFT: r2c6 (empty)\n- LEFT: r2c5 (empty)\n- DOWN: r3c5 (empty)\n- DOWN: r4c5 (G)\nNo walls hit, no out-of-bounds, ends at goal.

UP: r7c1 -> r6c1 (goal)\nThis path is 4 moves, stays in bounds, and avoids any issues.\n\n# Verification\nTrace the path:\n- Start: r9c2\n- LEFT: r9c1 (valid, col1 ok)\n- UP: r8c1 (valid)\n- UP: r7c1 (valid)\n- UP: r6c1 (goal reached)\nNo walls encountered, all moves valid, within 1-12 rows and 1-5 cols. Total displacement: -3 rows (up), -1 col (left). Correct.\n\n# Rethink (Optional)\nNo errors found; path is optimal and correct.\n\n# Summary\nThe grid has no obstacles, so direct movement works. Final verification: path reaches r6c1 in 4 moves without issues. Final proposed solution: LEFT, UP, UP, UP.</think>\n\n{\"solution\": [\"LEFT\",\"UP\",\"UP\",\"UP\"]}"}],"llmPathLength":4}

Only cardinal directions UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are allowed, without going out of bounds or through walls. The objective is to find a valid sequence of moves to reach the goal.\n\nKey constraints: Walls block movement; grid boundaries must be respected. Observations: Several open corridors exist, especially in rows 1, 5, 8 (1-based), but walls create obstacles, particularly along the right edge and in lower rows requiring detours.\n\n# Key Details\n- Player (@): r1c13\n- Goal (G): r10c8\n- Walls (#):\n  - r2c3, r2c13\n  - r3c13\n  - r4c6, r4c7, r4c11\n  - r6c4, r6c6, r6c11, r6c14\n  - r7c12\n  - r9c8, r9c13\n  - r10c12\n  - r11c3, r11c5, r11c9, r11c12\n\n# Strategy Formulation\nTo solve this, analyze the grid for viable paths. The right edge (columns 13-14) offers a mostly open descent from row1 to row5. From there, a wall at r6c14 blocks further direct descent, so shift left to c13, which is open down to row7. At row7c13, cannot descend directly due to r9c13 nearby, but at row7c12 blocked down (r9c13 affects path), so move left to c12 then c11 for descent.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. From r1c13, move RIGHT to r1c14 to access the rightmost column, which is largely open downward.\n2. Descend DOWN four times to r5c14, as rows 2-5 c14 are empty.\n3. LEFT to r5c13 (empty), avoiding r6c14 #.\n4. DOWN to r6c13 (empty).\n5. Continue DOWN twice to r8c13? Wait, adjust: actually from r6c13 DOWN to r7c13, but path refines to LEFT earlier for better access.\nRefined path: After reaching r5c13 via LEFT from r5c14, but simulation shows better to LEFT at row5 to c12 for smoother descent.\n\nFull path planned by simulating positions (0-based for precision, mapped to 1-based):\n- Start r1c13\n- RIGHT → r1c14\n- DOWN ×4 → r5c14\n- LEFT → r5c13\n- DOWN → r6c13\n- DOWN → r7c13\nNo, correction in simulation: from r5c13 DOWN is r6c13 index5 col12 -, yes; DOWN r7c13 index6 col12 - (row7 c13 index6,12 -); DOWN r8c13 index7,12 - (row8 all empty).\nEarlier path was to c12.\n\nActual verified sequence:\nRIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN (now at r5c14), LEFT (r5c13), DOWN (r6c13), DOWN (r7c13), DOWN (r8c13)?

From r10c1, column 1 down to r14c1 is clear: r10c1 (-), r11c1 (-), r12c1 (-), r13c1 (-), r14c1 (G). No walls block column 1 in rows 10-14. The walls are positioned elsewhere (upper middle and one in r9c11 above start, one in r13c10 not on path). This path is direct, matching Manhattan distance (10 left + 4 down = 14 moves). Proposed solution: 10 LEFT followed by 4 DOWN.\n\n# Verification\nSimulate path:\n- Start: r10c11\n- 10 LEFT: r10c10 to r10c1 (all empty on row 10)\n- DOWN to r11c1 (empty)\n- DOWN to r12c1 (empty)\n- DOWN to r13c1 (empty, wall at r13c10 irrelevant)\n- DOWN to r14c1 (G)\nNo moves into # cells. Path valid.\n\n# Rethink (Optional)\nNo errors found. Path optimal and clear.\n\n# Summary\nThe path of 10 LEFT then 4 DOWN successfully navigates to the goal without obstacles. Final verification: reaches r14c1, avoids all #. Solution confirmed.</think>\n\n{\"solution\": [\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"LEFT\",\"DOWN\",\"DOWN\",\"DOWN\",\"DOWN\"]}"}],"llmPathLength":14}

The primary goal is to reach the G at r7c12 from r11c5 using a sequence of these moves.\n\n# Key Details\n- Player starts at r11c5\n- Goal at r7c12\n- Walls (#) positions:\n  - r1c1\n  - r4c10\n  - r5c2, r5c5, r5c14\n  - r6c3, r6c9, r6c14\n  - r7c10\n  - r8c10\n  - r9c2, r9c11, r9c13\n  - r10c7, r10c14\n  - r11c3, r11c9\n- Grid bounds: rows 1-11 (1=top), columns 1-14 (left to right)\n- All other cells are passable empty spaces.\n\n# Strategy Formulation\nTo solve this, I analyzed the grid layout, identifying open paths and wall blockages. The goal is in the upper-right area, blocked by a partial wall at c10 in rows 4,7,8. However, row 10 offers a wide open path from c8 to c13, bypassing lower obstacles.

From r11c5, move right along row 11 (open c4-c8) to r11c8, just before the wall at r11c9.\n2. Move UP to r10c8 (open).\n3. Move right along row 10 (open c8-c13) to r10c12.\n4. Move UP through column 12: to r9c12, r8c12, r7c12 (G).\n\nThis avoids all walls, using the open corridor in row 10 and the narrow passage in c12 upwards.\n\nProposed solution: RIGHT x3, UP, RIGHT x4, UP x3.\n\n# Verification\nSimulate positions:\n- Start: r11c5\n- RIGHT: r11c6 (empty)\n- RIGHT: r11c7 (empty)\n- RIGHT: r11c8 (empty)\n- UP: r10c8 (empty)\n- RIGHT: r10c9 (empty)\n- RIGHT: r10c10 (empty)\n- RIGHT: r10c11 (empty)\n- RIGHT: r10c12 (empty)\n- UP: r9c12 (empty)\n- UP: r8c12 (empty)\n- UP: r7c12 (G)\nAll moves valid, no walls hit, within bounds.
