Inner playable area mostly open with internal walls at: row5 col8, row7 col4.\n- Player starts at row9 col7 (bottom center).\n- Boxes at: row4 col6 (upper middle), row6 col7 (middle), row7 col6 (lower middle).\n- Goals at: row3 col3 (upper leftish), row2 col9 (top right), row6 col2 (middle left).\n- 3 boxes, 3 goals. No boxes on goals initially.\n\n## Strategy Exploration\n- Box at row7 col6 is closest to goal row6 col2: can be pushed left to row7 col5, up to row6 col5, then left along row6 to col2. Path clear (row6 col3-6 empty). No deadlock as left side open until col2.\n- Box at row6 col7 suits goal row2 col9: push up column7 (all open: row5-2 col7 empty) to row2 col7, then right to col8 then col9. Column7 clear except temporary positions.\n- Box at row4 col6 to goal row3 col3: push up to row3 col6, then left along row3 (col6-3 open) to col3.\n- Order: solve lower box first (row7 col6 to row6 col2), then middle box (row6 col7 to row2 col9), then upper box (row4 col6 to row3 col3). This avoids blocking paths. No deadlocks: avoid pushing into walls/corners (e.g., not left of row7 col4 wall, not trapping behind row5 col8 wall). Player repositions easily via open paths.\n\n## Refinement\n- First box (row7 col6): UU to position, L push left, DLU to repostion below, R U to right side, LLL push left to goal.\n- Second box (row6 col7): RRRDR to below, UUUU push up to row2 col7, LU to left side, RR push right to goal.\n- Third box (row4 col6): DDLDL to below, U push up, RU to right side, LLL push left to goal.\n- Each push verified: target empty, no box interference, player can reach push positions via open spaces. Multiple consecutive pushes possible when player ends up in position for next.\n\n## Solution\nThe sequence solves all boxes: first to row6 col2 (moves 1-11), second to row2 col9 (12-24), third to row3 col3 (25-35). All goals filled, no deadlocks.\n</think>\n\n{\"solution\": \"UULDLURULLLRRRDRUUUULURRDDLDLURULLL\"}"}]}

This avoids the wall at (4,3) since upward pushes occur at column 5 where (4,5) is accessible.\n- Right box at (5,6) can then be pushed straight up to (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) without interference.\n- Potential deadlock: pushing left box to (3,3) would trap it as player cannot access (4,3) due to wall. Avoid by pushing up to row 2 before moving left.\n- Moving right box first would place it on (2,6), blocking access to push left box leftward in row 2.\n- No boxes are well-positioned yet; both need upward movement primarily.\n\n## Refinement\n- First, move player to (5,5) via bottom row and up: RRRUU.\n- Push up twice: UU, placing box at (2,5), player at (3,5).\n- Move to (2,6) to enable left pushes: RU.\n- Push left twice: LL, placing left box on (2,3), player at (2,4).\n- Navigate around right box at (5,6) to (6,6) via column 4 down: DDDDRR (uses empty column 4 path: (3,4)-(6,4)-(6,6)).\n- Push right box up three times: UUU, placing it on (2,6).\n- All pushes have clear space behind boxes; paths avoid occupied cells and walls.\n\n## Solution\nThe sequence RRRUUUURULLDDDDRRUUU solves the puzzle:\n- RRRUU positions player at (5,5).\n- UU pushes left box to (2,5).\n- RU positions at (2,6).\n- LL pushes left box to (2,3).\n- DDDDRR positions at (6,6) avoiding right box.\n- UUU pushes right box to (2,6).\nBoth boxes on goals.\n</think>\n\n{\"solution\": \"RRRUUUURULLDDDDRRUUU\"}"}]}
